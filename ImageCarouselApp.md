# Shopify Image Slider and Carousel App Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the Shopify Image Slider and Carousel App documentation. This app is designed to help Shopify merchants enhance the visual presentation of their online stores by adding image sliders and carousels. Below, you'll find essential information on how to use the app effectively.

## Workflow

1. **Welcome Page**: Start by opening the app, where you'll find a welcome page. Click the "Create" button to begin.

2. **Carousel Creation**: You'll be redirected to a page that allows you to choose the type of carousel you want to create. You can select from three types: 
   - Image slideshow on hover
   - Manually controlled carousel
   - Automatically sliding carousel

3. **Image Upload**: After choosing the carousel type, you can upload images for the carousel and configure its settings.

4. **Saving Settings**: Make sure to save the carousel settings once you've customized them to your liking.

5. **Adding to Store**: With the app extension, you can choose from your list of carousels and add them as sections to your Shopify store.

## Carousel Types and Settings

- **Image Slideshow on Hover**: This type displays a slideshow when users hover over a specific image.
- **Manually Controlled Carousel**: Allows manual control of carousel navigation.
- **Automatically Sliding Carousel**: This carousel type automatically transitions between images. You can configure sliding speed, the number of images, and navigation options.

## Integration with Product Catalog (Future Enhancement)

We plan to add integration with the Shopify product catalog in the future. For now, the app operates with manual setup.

## Creating Multiple Carousels

You can create multiple carousels and sliders for your store. The number of sliders will depend on the billing package you choose. The pro billing package will allow an unlimited number of sliders and carousels.

## Advanced Features (Future Enhancement)

We are considering additional features such as text captions, links, or buttons for images in future updates.

## Mobile Responsiveness

We aim to make the app fully responsive for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Support and Documentation

For assistance and support, refer to the basic setup guide that accompanies the app. If you have further questions, please contact our support team.

## Pricing

Pricing plans and subscription models are still under consideration and will be announced soon.

## Development Status

This is an initial Shopify app development project, and we will continue to enhance it based on user feedback and needs.
